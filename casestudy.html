                        Movie Flix is a web application developed using the MERN
                        stack. It allows users to have access to information
                        about movies, directors and genres. Users can create an
                        account, update their personal information and select
                        their favorite movies.

                      <p>
                        Movie Flix is a personal project that I built as part of
                        my web development course at careerfoundry to
                        demonstrate my full stack javascript development.
                      </p>

                      <h4>Objective</h4>
                      <p>
                        The objective was to build a complete web application
                        using full-stack Javascript technologies to add to my
                        portfolio. My challenge here was to build both
                        server-side and client-side of the application from
                        scratch.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  
                  <!-- Approach client side -->
                  <div class="main-container purpose">
                    <div class="main-content ">
                    <h4>Approach</h4>
                      <h4 class = "overview-title">Server-Side</h4>
                      <p>
                        Node.js and Express were used to create the RESTful API
                        which will be accessed using HTTP methods. MongoDB was
                        used to create the user and movie database and hosted on
                        MongoDB Atlas. Mongoose was used to model the business
                        logic. API was tested using Postman. Users were
                        authenticated and authorized using HTTP authentication
                        and JWT authentication.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <!-- Image -->
                  <div>
                    <img class="imgclass" src="assets/images/casestudyimages/movielist.png"/>
                  </div>
                  <!-- End Image -->
                  
                  <!-- Client Side -->
                  <div class="main-container purpose overview">
                    <div class="main-content ">
                      <h4>Approach</h4>
                      <h4 class = "overview-title">Client-Side</h4>
                      <p>
                        Next I built the user interface that will be used to
                        send requests and receive responses from the server-side
                        React & Redux were used to create a single page
                        application Several interface views were built like the
                        login view, registration view, profile view(shows user
                        information). Bootstrap was used for styling and
                        responsiveness.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <!-- Image -->
                        <div>
                          <img
                            class="imgclass"
                            src="assets/images/casestudyimages/Screenshot3.png"
                          />
                        </div>
                        <div>
                          <img
                            class="imgclass"
                            src="assets/images/casestudyimages/Screenshot4.png"
                          />
                        </div>

                      <p>
                        Working on the server-side of the app was very exciting.
                        I had some past experience working with SQL and was
                        familiar with creating database with SQL. I used this
                        experience to quickly learn CRUD with PostgreSQL.
                        However, non-relational database concept was completely
                        new to me. I had to go over the lessons and went through
                        several resource links to come up the learning curve and
                        understand the differences (table based SQL and document
                        based NoSQL databases). Working through examples and
                        practicing the CRUD operations made me comfortable using
                        MongoDB to create the database for my project.

                      <p>
                        Working with React was very challenging. Concepts including
                        class components, hooks, passing props were new to me. After
                        reading through the lesson a few times, I used the extra
                        resource links at the end of the chapter to read more
                        in-depth about the topics. Researching online for tutorials
                        helped me grasp the concept better and use them confidently
                        in the project.

                      <h4 >Debugging Challenges</h4>
                      <p>
                        Querying the database using the client interface resulted in
                        errors. It took time to debug those errors. Debugging with a
                        lot of print statements, as well as commenting out the code,
                        I was finally able to find the errors which was coming from the API side. Overcoming these challenges helped me understand the working of server-side and client-side much better. This experience will help me with my future projects to be more efficient. Movie Flix was definitely the most challenging project that I worked on during my course at CareerFoundry.
